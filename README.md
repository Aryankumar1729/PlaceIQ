## The Problem

Every placement season, 2M+ Indian BTech students face the same chaos — interview questions scattered across 50 GFG tabs, company data buried in WhatsApp groups, and zero way to track which companies they've applied to. PlaceIQ fixes this.

---

## What It Does

- **500+ real PYQs** scraped from GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode Discuss across 15+ companies
- **Company-specific prep targets** — set a target for Google, Wipro, Atlassian separately and track progress per company
- **AI-powered chat** using Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) to answer placement-related queries instantly
- **Job application tracker** — track every drive, OA, interview round, and offer in one place
- **Smart search** — search "arrays" → prep page with DSA questions, search "TCS" → company page
- **JWT authentication** — secure register/login with bcrypt password hashing
- **Real-time dashboard** — live company count, PYQ count, and student count from actual database

## Data Pipeline

```
GFG / LeetCode Discuss
        ↓
Python Scraper (BeautifulSoup + GraphQL)
        ↓
Question extraction + classification
        ↓
PostgreSQL (Neon) via psycopg2
        ↓
Prisma ORM → Next.js API Routes
        ↓
React Frontend
```

Scraper auto-classifies questions into DSA / Aptitude / HR / Technical and tags difficulty based on keyword analysis. Unique constraint on `(question, companyId)` prevents duplicates on re-runs.

## Why This Exists

Built this during placement season after watching batchmates scramble through 20 browser tabs trying to find "what does TCS ask in round 2". The data exists — it's just fragmented across the internet. PlaceIQ puts it in one place, organized, searchable, and personalized to your actual shortlists.
